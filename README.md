## üëâ Who is Joakim Vivas?

I'll tell you right off the bat that **I'm from '83 and I studied EGB** (it seems like a lie), I live in Sant Cugat del Vall√®s although I was born in Barcelona.

**I like to read and several books have left their mark on me** but, without a doubt, a phrase taken from the book "[The 5 AM Club](https://amzn.to/2GdFhYk)" made sense: **‚ÄúNever stop improving‚Äù** Here I am, constantly improving to grow as a professional and as a person.

Well! Let me tell you that **I'm a father (what a challenge!)** maybe it's my first job. But, well, let's get back to the point, I studied computer science but I love knowing "both sides of the pie", the technological side and the commercial/product side, so I decided to study a business degree. Of course, every day I have a new learning experience because I have a lot to know, discover and learn.

**I started my career 20 years ago, yes, a long time ago...** However, I have been accumulating, in my backpack, learnings from my professional experiences. Luckily (or not), I have worked in small, medium and large companies and in each step or stage of my life I had (and will have) learned.

**I am passionate about üöÄ StartUps** and, when I have time (not much), I am an Advisor, I love helping them from the beginning to understand early ideas and turn them into practical, scalable and profitable companies.

**I love üéôÔ∏è teaching** because it is where I can improve my soft skills (communication, time management, teamwork, etc...) and hard skills (mastery, content, review,...), in short, this is where I can "touch" reality, I love preparing classes, reading papers, studying cases, making prototypes, etc... and presenting the topics and talking with the students.
